## Testing the md to blog pipeline
If I get this working this will be a way to write blog posts in obsidian and have them automatically published to my website. 

I have three goals with this setup:
1. Have my blogs formatted the same in obsidian and on my website
2. Automatic updating from my obsidian to my website by deploying after saving in obsidian 
3. Have the formatting, specifically latex formatting to appear the same on obsidian as it does on my website. 

This is a test file. 

Import an image

<img src="/website-posts/publish/images/total_calories.png" alt="Total Calories" width="500px" />

This is another example of a line. 

And hopefully this is another paragraph.
