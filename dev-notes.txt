npm run dev // starts the dev environment in a local host 
npm run build // creates an optimized version of the build in the dist folder
npm install // install packages to npm 
npm run deploy // deploys site to github pages 
npm run // to see all scripts in package.json

Steps to adding a new page 
- Add file to page folder e.g. newpage.tsx
- inhereit style from home.css or make a new css file
- Import page file and add route to App.tsx
- Ensure class names match up and link names are correct
- Add link to sidebar.tsx with correct paths

Steps to add a blog
- Put note in obsidian vault with the title id
- Add meta data to src/blog-meta-data/metadata.json, id mush match the name of the note 
- If metadata id matches the card should automatically appear with the content rendered from obsidian on click
NB: Need to use html for images and mathajax notation for equations (CHECK IF I CAN CHANGE THIS...)

# Imports 
- MathJax
- react-markdown
- markdown-to-jsx

Added obsidian vault to the public website-posts/published/ folder 
    - Need to manually add metadata to src/content/blog-metadata/metadata.json file 
        - The id needs to math the title of the article 
    TODO: Fix the image rendered from the .md file
          Test latex 
Removed the header from the blog posts 
Fixed the carousel 

- Fixed the image issue with obsidian and website. Now you need to use raw html to load an image. The image does not appear in obsidian but it works on the website.
- Got Latex rendering working between obsidian notes and website format. 
- Moved the content for homepage and research page to obsidian as well in the folder public/website-posts/content/
    - moved meta data for blog previews to src/blog-meta-data/metadata.json for cleaner paths 
    - Titles are now in the respective tsx files, ex. "Reseach" in Reseach.tsx
    - Homepage and Reseach content now comes from obsidian files 

TODO:
- Add reading page (format books read and current reading list as well as recommendations)
- Add fitness page (timeline with pictures, potentially a space for clients)
