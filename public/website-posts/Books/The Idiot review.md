The Idiot follows Prince Myshkin, the heir to a large fortune returning to Russian society after being treated since childhood in a Swiss sanatorium for his fits of epilepsy. The novel contrasts in the character of Myshkin the unadulterated goodness of a childlike innocence with the depravity and greed of Russian society. Myshkin is often confused for a symbol of naivety, but, far from it, Myshkin is the embodiment of the idea of Christ as a 'man-god.' Myshkin, nouveau riche, is cast headlong into the affairs of Russian high society, where he elicits great intrigue as a queer outsider and an easy dupe. Myshkins moral compass draws him to the suffering of each character, and finds himself overwhelmed in light of the competing burdens. 

I would not recommend this book for the uninitiated to Dostoyevsky. Its themes and motifs draw heavily on Dostoyevsky's larger body of work: suicide, revelation through epilepsy, human suffering, the 'shadow' of psychology, nihilism and atheism (embodied by my favourite character Ippolit, a bright young invalid with a terminal illness), and salvation through beauty and true love. However, this book had the single greatest impact on my life and still to this day I find myself pondering the story of Marie and the choice of Myshkin. In this novel Dostoyevsky's ability to evoke the diaphanous concept of *meaning* is at its most consummate.
