## Self-Interacting Dark Matter
My main research project concerns the effect of self-interacting dark matter(SIDM) on the morphology of dark matter halos.  \\( \\Lambda \rm CDM \\) is the current standard cosmological model, wherein the structure of the Universe is dictated by the cosmological constant, \\( \\Lambda \\), and a cold, collisionless, dark matter component, \\( \rm CDM \\). However, on length scales less than an \\( \rm Mpc \\) \\( \rm CDM \\) faces challenges. Namely, observations of dwarf and low-surface-brightness dark matter (DM) halos prefer nearly constant density cores, while \\( \rm CDM \\)-only simulations predict cores with a steep rising density called a cusp. The so-called core-cusp problem motivated the self-interacting model, proposed by Spergel and Steindhart in 1999. This model modifies the inner, dense part of the halo where interactions are frequent while retaining the \\( \rm CDM \\)-like properties in the outer halo where interactions are rare enough to treat the region as effectively collisionless, making it a lightweight and economical solution to the core-cusp problem.  

Apart from producing the cored profiles required by observation, frequent self-interaction also tend to erase ellipticity, causing halos to be more spherical than predicted by \\( \rm CDM \\) simulations. This predication of SIDM halos provides an observational probe with which researchers can distinguish between \\( \rm CDM \\) and SIDM, possibly uncovering clues as to the particle nature of DM. 

As simulations have become more sophisticated it became possible to model DM halos with baryonic matter. Depending on the implementation of baryonic physics, the core-cusp problem is eased. However, one issue that persists is that of the diversity of rotation curves for similar DM halos. \\( \rm CDM \\) predicts a universal profile that depends on the halo mass. However, the inner part of observed rotation curves is observed to be much more diverse than expected in \\( \rm CDM \\) and has not been explained with the inclusion of baryons into \\( \rm CDM \\) simulations. SIDM simulations with baryons, however, does lead to the expected diversity observed owing to the response of SIDM to the baryon potential. The potential of SIDM to solve this lingering problem of diversity constitutes the main appeal of the model at the present time. 

My work focuses on the development of a semi-analytic model of SIDM based on solutions to the Jeans equations. The Jeans model ...
