A Hero of Our Time written in 1839 marks the introduction of the superfluous man to the realm of Russian literature. Perchorin, the titular Hero, or rather anti-hero, is the archetypal superfluous man, and serves as the inception of a new type of literary character in whom the then-new ideas of nihilism, existentialism, and alienation are expressed. Dostoyevsky's Raskilnikov, Ivan Karamazov, Prince Myshkin, Stavrogin; Tolstoys Nekhlyudov, Levin, Bolkonsky; Turgnev's Bazarov; Bely's Nikolai; and many of Checkov's characters inherit from Lermontov's portrayal of a man untethered from social norms in light of modern science, industry, and the erosion of faith. A Hero of Our Time follows the intelligent and charismatic Russian officer, Pechorin, on his escapades through the Caucasus. In search of meaning and unheeded by any social or religious ideals Perchorin is led to seek out human experiences for sport; exploiting, manipulating, and even killing anyone in the process. Through non-chronological episodes the reader becomes increasingly acquainted with Pechorin's philandering, exploits, frame of mind, and existential musings on life, death, and love. 

This book makes my favourite list for two reasons: 1) being a precursor and model from which the Golden Era of Russian literature derives its most powerful archetype; and 2) for itself being a masterful work of psychological and existential fiction. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested, has read, or become similarly infatuated with Russian literature and wants to more deeply explore the origin of the ideas so deftly espoused therein and that still permeate questions of meaning in the postmodern world.
