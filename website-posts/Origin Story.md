Outside of physics and fitness, I spend the majority of my time reading, writing, and playing sports. When I was 12 years old I found an old copy of *Aristotles Politics* in my Father's collection of books from his University days. I've no clue what possessed me to attempt to read it, and "attempt" is perhaps too generous a word still, but read it I did. I remember being shocked by the ideas I encountered therein--chief among them an attack on democracy and a defence of slavery. At 12 years old I didn't know much but I did know that democracy was good and slavery was bad. This marks possibly the first time I can recall when what I thought I knew to be absolutely true was challenged. The feeling I then had was one of unbearable discomfort. I knew Aristotle must be wrong, but I didn't know why or where he was wrong, much less did I know how to begin to articulate a counter-argument. 

The next portentous event was owed to my brother, Jordan. Being 8 years my senior he often would mess with me, as all older brothers do. One day he asked me "do you believe in God?" to which I responded "of course I do" (at the time I'd never questioned it, after all I used to pray during hockey games that God would allow me to score a goal!). He took a beat then replied "why," after which he buzzed off, happy to leave me with the torment of an existential question I suppose. In fact the simple "why" was enough to completely restructure neural pathways. Again the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing stirred my soul.

Reading has long been my primary passion. To be sure, it was a deep curiosity and finding an outlet in books that first led me to read about physics. I did not know it at the time, but picking up A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking was to dictate the trajectory of my life profoundly. Entering University exposed

While I have always enjoyed reading, it was due to reading a copy of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy in the first year of my undergrad that rewired my brain permanently. In a few short years following War and Peace I devoured large portions of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Gogol, and Chekhov. Through the Russian Literature I had made contact with Existentialism, pursing the works of Camus, Sartre, Kafka, and Nietzsche. Through Existentialism I came to appreciate philosophy in general, becoming enthralled by the works of Epicurus, Plato, Hume, Russell and Nozick. Following these threads I also became preoccupied with the question of God and atheism, finding refuge in the mid-2000s movement of New Atheism. Authors like Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens did much to satiate my desire for a consistent, secular, and scientific worldview, while the later--Hitchens--for a long while became my primary role model. Through Christopher Hitchens I have developed an abiding love for free-thought, contrarianism, writing, debate, and secular-humanistic civilization. These
